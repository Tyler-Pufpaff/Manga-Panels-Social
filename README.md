MVP of a full-stack social network app focused on sharing manga panels

## How It's Made:

Tech Used: JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS/CSS/HTML, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Passport.js, multer, Node.js


## Lessons Learned:

Architecting the app beforehand is a huge time saver. I had to feel out a few services for storing images and went with Cloudinary. Definitely upped my comfortability using EJS in this app. Would love to flesh this out more in the future.

## To Do:

- Add deletion of posts
- Add username IDs to comments added on posts
- Further style Profile pages i.e. make app Brand; colors, logo, vibe, etc.
